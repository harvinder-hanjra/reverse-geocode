# Reverse Geocode

An exploration of offline reverse geocoding — given (lat, lon), return the
country and administrative region in the browser, with no server, no API key,
and no network calls after initial load.

Three separate implementations were built to compare different spatial indexing
strategies at the same problem. Each has its own binary format, builder, and
interactive map UI.

## The problem

Reverse geocoding is conceptually simple: given a point, find which polygon
contains it. The naive implementation — load all polygons, test each one — is
far too slow for interactive use and the polygon data is hundreds of megabytes.

The challenge is building a data structure that:
- fits in a small binary file (< 60 MB, ideally < 15 MB)
- can be loaded entirely into browser memory
- answers queries in microseconds, not milliseconds
- requires no server — pure static file serving

All three implementations solve this by pre-computing the hard part (polygon
containment) at build time and collapsing the result into a compact spatial
index that the browser can search with simple arithmetic.


## Data source

**GADM 4.1** (Global Administrative Areas) provides ADM2-level boundaries for
the entire world: districts, counties, prefectures — the second level of
administrative subdivision within each country.

The data comes as a SQLite database. `extract_gadm.py` queries it to produce
a flat GeoJSON FeatureCollection with `country`, `adm1`, and `adm2` properties
on each feature.

GADM was chosen over alternatives like geoBoundaries because:
- it has global coverage with no significant gaps
- the polygons are consistent in structure
- it distinguishes country / adm1 / adm2 cleanly


## The basemap (adm2_render.geojson)

The map rendered in each UI is not tiles. It is a single GeoJSON file
containing all 47 205 administrative boundaries, simplified to 0.01° (~1 km)
tolerance, with integer feature IDs that match the geocoder's `admin_id`
values.

    geocoder.lookup(lat, lon)
           |
           v returns admin_id  (integer 0–47204)
           |
    adminMap.get(admin_id)
           |
           v returns { country, adm1, adm2 }  from GeoJSON properties


The GeoJSON is separate from the geocoding index because the geocoder only
needs to return an integer — the names live in the basemap which is already
loaded for rendering. This avoids duplicating name data in the binary.

`make_render_geojson.py` builds it from the same prep binary used by the z0
builder, so the feature IDs are guaranteed to match.


## Architecture shared by all three UIs

Each UI loads two files at startup in parallel:

    fetch("adm2_render.geojson")    fetch("*_geo.bin")
              |                              |
              v                             v
      build adminMap                  parse binary
      stamp country colours           init geocoder
              |                              |
              +------------- both ready -----+
                                   |
                              attach to map
                         (layers: land, dividers, hl, hl-border)


On every mousemove (via requestAnimationFrame to avoid redundant frames):

    mouse position
         |
         v
    map.unproject()  →  (lat, lng)
         |
         +--→  geocoder.lookup(lat, lng)  →  admin_id / {names} / null
         |           (timed with performance.now())
         |
         +--→  map.queryRenderedFeatures()  →  feature id for highlight
         |
         v
    map.setFeatureState(id, { on: true })   ← GPU feature-state, zero CPU
    ui.update(names, timing, coords)         ← floating tooltip


The highlight is decoupled from the geocoder result so it always reflects the
rendered map, even if the geocoder and GeoJSON were built from different data.


## Approach comparison

All three read an in-memory binary blob fetched once at page load and answer
every subsequent query in pure JavaScript with no network calls.

- **z0** uses a two-layer scheme: a coarse 0.25° grid covers ~97% of land
  queries in a single array lookup, and a Morton-sorted boundary table handles
  the rest. Lookup is typically < 1 µs.
- **s2** packs H3 cells into compact 32-bit keys and organises them into
  64-byte cache-line blocks for two-level binary search. Interior queries hit
  the coarse (res-6) table; boundary queries fall through to the fine (res-7)
  table.
- **h3** stores raw 64-bit H3 cell IDs in a flat sorted array and binary-searches
  with a three-resolution fallback (res 6 → 5 → 4). The 64-bit keys require
  BigInt arithmetic in JavaScript but the implementation is the simplest of the
  three.

## Accuracy

Benchmarked against Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) ground truth on 56 major world
cities + 3 ocean control points:

<!-- prettier table -->
                 z0          s2          h3
    -----------------------------------------------
    correct      51 / 56     55 / 56     51 / 56
    accuracy     91 %        98 %        91 %

**s2** achieves 98% — only Istanbul is missed (the benchmark coordinate lands
in an H3 cell whose centroid falls in the Bosphorus strait).

**z0** and **h3** miss 5 cities each.  z0 misses Singapore, Athens, Nuuk,
Port Louis, and Praia — the 0.25° grid cell centroid falls in open water for
each (narrow coastlines / small islands).  h3 shares the same root cause:
Istanbul, Reykjavik, Auckland, Nuuk, and Praia all have their lookup cell
centroid in water.

All remaining misses are inherent to centroid-based spatial indexing on
narrow peninsulas and small islands, not data gaps.

Run `python bench/accuracy.py` to reproduce (uses cached Nominatim results).
